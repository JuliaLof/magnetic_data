# Magnetic data processing
Scripts for processing data from magnetic measurements. They will take in data from hysteresis measurements and process and pick out different parts of the files in order to find interesting parameters such as coercivity and the ratio between magnetic remanence and magnetic saturation. It will also plot the hysteresis loops.
